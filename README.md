# Lost To Time - Video Game

## Game concept

Players embody a scientist imprisoned in a retro-futuristic, brutalist facility. They soon discover that they have the power to rewind objects over time. Piecing together that their daughter is in the same facility, frozen in time as a result of a failed experiment, they must learn to use their time powers, locate their daughter, and escape. They do this by solving time-based puzzles to advance through rooms.

## üöÄ¬†Proof of Concept Releases & Testing Builds

To streamline & optimize our software development process, we released multiple prototype iterations to test specific features and mechanics at different stages of development. Each aimed at evaluating and refining different aspects of the game.

## üéØ Strategic definitions

### Player persona:

"Lost To Time" strives to reach an audience whose **gaming motivations** are based on immersing in compelling first-person stories and mastering complex puzzles. This target audience is looking for games where violence and fast pace are not the main drivers, instead, they crave puzzle-based and stealth challenges. 

### Level design:

The game demo has 4 levels, each one designed to help the player get a sense of his newfound power. Each one has a specific objective:

| Description | Screenshot|
| --- | --- |
| Level One introduces the player to the character's backstory and to its power through environmental storytelling, setting the tone for the entire game. It also prompts the user with the first puzzle they need to solve. | <img src="https://github.com/Interactive-Rocket/p-LostToTime-game/blob/documentation/Assets/Art/Images/gameplay%2004.jpg"> |
| Levels two and three are the scenarios of the waste disposal hub, which introduce moving objects in (2) level two and expose the player to its first real danger. | <img src="https://github.com/Interactive-Rocket/p-LostToTime-game/blob/documentation/Assets/Art/Images/gameplay%2003.jpg"> |
| Level three (3) is the last and most challenging scenario of the Waste Disposal Hub. It introduces jumping combos with grabbing and time mechanics. In the actual release, the waste disposal hub will consist of multiple and increasingly tough puzzles that will challenge the user's problem-solving abilities. | <img src="https://github.com/Interactive-Rocket/p-LostToTime-game/blob/documentation/Assets/Art/Images/gameplay%2002.jpg"> |
| Finally, level four (4) is a glimpse of what a transition level would look like, which introduces more context and reveals to the character that his daughter is alive. The large map is an example of an in-screen that explains how big the facility is and the character's new goal: rescue his daughter. | <img src="https://github.com/Interactive-Rocket/p-LostToTime-game/blob/documentation/Assets/Art/Images/gameplay%2001.jpg"> |
